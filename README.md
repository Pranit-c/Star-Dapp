## Objective
*The word star is used interchangeably for the word Token in the context of Blockchain*
1) Generate a smart contract function to create a star.
2) Use another smart contract function to put a star up for sale on the blockchain. 
3) Also create a smart contract function to buy a star. 
4) Add additional functionality to name the star tokens. 
5) Another additional functionality to exchange and transfer star tokens. 
6) Add supporting test cases for each of these added functionalities. 
7) Create a simple front-end website that allows the user to interact with these features. 
8) Deploy the smart contract to the public Goerli test network. 
## Conclusion:
Based on udacity's Blockchain Developer Project 5, the decentralized star notary app, is a great example of how blockchain technology can be used to create decentralized apps that provide secure and transparent ownership of assets. The project methodology involved the Agile approach, which allowed for frequent testing and feedback, ensuring that the app was built to meet the requirements of the users. The app architecture consisted of smart contracts and a user interface built using the Truffle and React frameworks, respectively. Overall, the star notary app provides a great starting point for developers looking to build decentralized apps on the Ethereum blockchain.
